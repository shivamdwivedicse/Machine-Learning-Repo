# Machine-Learning-Repo
🚀 Machine Learning Learning Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Learning Repository 📊🤖

This repository contains all my practice files, notebooks, and mini-projects that I created while learning Machine Learning from scratch.
It represents my complete learning journey — from basics to applied ML models.

This repo is a central place where I store:-
1.Concepts I learned.
2.Code I practiced.
3.Models I built.
4.Experiments I tried.
Everything is implemented using Python and popular Machine Learning libraries.

🧠 Topics Covered:-

 Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding
Feature Scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
Train-Test Split

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-

Data understanding & cleaning.
Visualizations using matplotlib & seaborn.
Outlier detection.
Correlation analysis.

Statistics for Machine Learning:-
Measure of Central Tendency.
Measure of Dispersion.
Z-Test.
Chi-Square Test.
Outlier detection techniques.

Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented:-

Linear Regression.
Logistic Regression.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Naive Bayes.
Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Decision Tree.
Random Forest.
XGBoost.

Each model includes:-

Training
Prediction
Evaluation

Model Evaluation & Optimization:-

Accuracy Score.
MAE, MSE, RMSE.
R² Score.
Confusion Matrix.
Classification Report.
Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV.
